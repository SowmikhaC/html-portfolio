<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a person who finds joy in creativity and innovation. I love exploring new ideas, thinking outside the box, 
  and bringing imagination to life through whatever I create. For me, creativity isn’t just about art — it’s about 
  solving problems in unique ways and finding inspiration in the smallest details of everyday life.</p>

<p>I’m deeply fascinated by artificial intelligence and technology. I enjoy learning how things work behind the scenes 
  — from coding and smart systems to the innovations that are shaping our future. Technology excites me because it’s always 
  evolving, and I love being part of that change, exploring how AI can make life simpler, smarter, and more connected.</p>

<p>At my core, I’m a curious learner and a creator who believes in the power of ideas. I’m passionate about blending creativity 
  with technology to build meaningful and futuristic solutions. My goal is to keep learning, experimenting, and innovating — to 
  turn my curiosity into something impactful and inspiring.</p>
